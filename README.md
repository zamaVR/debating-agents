# Dostoyevsky Debaters

A specialized AI debate platform focused on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's literary works. The system orchestrates three AI agents to engage in structured, scholarly debates about classic literature topics from Dostoyevsky's novels, including *Crime and Punishment*, *The Brothers Karamazov*, and other masterpieces. The platform uses a mediator agent to frame rounds, manage the flow, and provide recaps, while two debater agents present arguments with citations from their specialized knowledge bases.

## How Debate Rounds Work

The Dostoyevsky Debaters platform uses a sophisticated 4-round debate structure designed to create engaging, scholarly discussions about literary topics:

### Round Structure

**Round 1: Opening Arguments**
- **Mediator Phase**: Frames the debate topic and introduces the question
- **Agent Responses**: Both agents present their initial positions with citations
- **Mediator Recap**: Summarizes opening arguments and identifies key points

**Round 2: Rebuttals** 
- **Mediator Phase**: Introduces rebuttal round with specific instructions
- **Agent Responses**: Agents challenge each other's claims with concrete quotes and citations
- **Mediator Recap**: Analyzes agreements and disagreements

**Round 3: Cross-Examination**
- **Mediator Phase**: Directs agents to examine evidence and find weaknesses
- **Agent Responses**: Agents present counter-evidence and address opponent's key points
- **Mediator Recap**: Evaluates the strength of arguments

**Round 4: Final Arguments**
- **Mediator Phase**: Introduces final round for strongest case presentation
- **Agent Responses**: Agents make their strongest arguments and address key points
- **Mediator Recap**: Provides closing summary (no winner declared)

### Debate Phases Within Each Round

1. **Framing**: Mediator introduces the round and provides specific instructions
2. **Answer**: Both agents respond simultaneously with their arguments
3. **Round Recap**: Mediator summarizes what each agent said and notes agreements/disagreements
4. **Next Round**: Mediator introduces the next round (except after final round)

### Real-Time Streaming

- **Conversational Delays**: Natural pauses between responses (500-2000ms)
- **Live Updates**: Server-Sent Events stream each phase as it happens
- **Citation Display**: Citations appear with filename and chunk references
- **Phase Indicators**: Clear labeling of each debate phase

## Architecture

The system consists of three specialized AI agents:

1. **Agent A (General Literature Expert)**: Provides broad literary knowledge and context about Dostoyevsky's works, characters, and themes
2. **Agent B (Citation Specialist)**: Requires specific citations for all claims, using only knowledge base content with [filename, chunk #] references
3. **Mediator (Debate Moderator)**: Manages debate flow, frames rounds, provides recaps, and guides the scholarly discussion

## Sample Debate Topics

The platform comes pre-configured with classic Dostoyevsky debate topics:

- **"Does 'The Grand Inquisitor' claim that freedom is a burden rather than a gift?"**
- **"Is Raskolnikov's crime in Crime and Punishment justified by his theory of extraordinary men?"**
- **"Does Dostoevsky present Sonya as a true moral exemplar in Crime and Punishment?"**

These topics explore Dostoyevsky's central themes of:
- Moral philosophy and ethical dilemmas
- The nature of freedom vs. security
- Psychological complexity of characters
- Religious and existential questions
- Social criticism and human nature

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- TypeScript
- Access to AI agent APIs (OpenAI-compatible endpoints)
- Environment variables for agent configurations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd debating-agents
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your agent configurations:
```env
# Agent A Configuration
AGENT_A_BASE_URL=https://your-agent-a-endpoint.com/v1
AGENT_A_KEY=your-agent-a-api-key

# Agent B Configuration  
AGENT_B_BASE_URL=https://your-agent-b-endpoint.com/v1
AGENT_B_KEY=your-agent-b-api-key

# Mediator Configuration
AGENT_MEDIATOR_BASE_URL=https://your-mediator-endpoint.com/v1
AGENT_MEDIATOR_KEY=your-mediator-api-key
```

## Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Building for Production

Build the TypeScript code:
```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

## API Usage

### Start a Debate

**POST** `/api/debate`

Request body:
```json
{
  "topic": "Does 'The Grand Inquisitor' claim that freedom is a burden rather than a gift?"
}
```

Response: Server-Sent Events stream with debate messages

Event types:
- `start`: Debate initialization
- `message`: Debate entry (agent response, mediator note, etc.)
- `complete`: Debate finished
- `error`: Error occurred

## Deployment on Digital Ocean App Platform

### 1. Prepare for Deployment

Ensure your `package.json` has the correct build and start scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/server.js"
  }
}
```

### 2. Create App Spec

Create a `.do/app.yaml` file:
```yaml
name: debating-agents
services:
- name: web
  source_dir: /
  github:
    repo: your-username/debating-agents
    branch: main
  run_command: npm start
  build_command: npm run build
  environment_slug: node-js
  instance_count: 1
  instance_size_slug: basic-xxs
  http_port: 3000
  envs:
  - key: NODE_ENV
    value: production
  - key: AGENT_A_BASE_URL
    value: ${AGENT_A_BASE_URL}
  - key: AGENT_A_KEY
    value: ${AGENT_A_KEY}
  - key: AGENT_B_BASE_URL
    value: ${AGENT_B_BASE_URL}
  - key: AGENT_B_KEY
    value: ${AGENT_B_KEY}
  - key: AGENT_MEDIATOR_BASE_URL
    value: ${AGENT_MEDIATOR_BASE_URL}
  - key: AGENT_MEDIATOR_KEY
    value: ${AGENT_MEDIATOR_KEY}
```
